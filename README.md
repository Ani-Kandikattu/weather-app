# Weather App

## Description

This challenge involved creating a weather app that could be used to view the weather in the city entered. It is useful for travel as it can show the forecast.
I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a server side API in order to complete this challenge.
This app also stores previously searched cities in local storage.
I learned how to utilize server side apis in order to fetch data and display it to the webpage.
